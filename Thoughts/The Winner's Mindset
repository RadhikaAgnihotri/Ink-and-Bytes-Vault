I make tough decisions,
Some for the present, most for future me,
They make my present uncomfortable,
But in the long run, sweet fruits of toil I'll reap.

I deny myself the distractions' sway,
With steadfast focus on my goal each day.
I shall become a challenge for my own challenges,
Strength emanates from deep within my soul.

The same obstacles you face, even I see,
Time, circumstances or destiny.
Yet, I will burn the midnight oil,
Till "fear of not trying" bends to toil.

Outside, the world may flip its course,
Yet within, my serenity must hold its force.
The outer shall catch-up to my inner tune,
In this steadfast faith, within, I bloom.

I know I am alone in this
The world will join when I win
Only He's always been
both outside and within
