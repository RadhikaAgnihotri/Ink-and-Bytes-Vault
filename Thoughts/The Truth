The Truth...

Fear of getting started,
Afraid to say no,
Telling white lies,
And putting up a fake show.
 
Loving people you don't like
Therefore losing those who treat you right
Running out of breath and time
Dreams and heart shatter at the same time

Ready to be harsh on your own self,
Failing to see the glow,
Appreciating things of little to no value,
Just to fit in this globe.

Stuck in the "what ifs,"
Will I fail or will it not work out?
Oh mortal man, what if it did,
And fear kept you from finding out?

Your struggles will be remembered if you succeed,
So why worry about failure? Keep adding to your list.
One will surely lead you to be,
For it's not failure that inspires, but rising from it persistently.

Your struggles are remembered only when you succeed,
So why fret over failure? Keep adding to your deed.
One endeavor will lead you to be,
For it's not the fall, but the rise, that inspires truly.

Are you really thinking you are here to stay,
Pleasing everyone only to be gone one day,
You are doing just fine whilst alive,
And after life will be just okay.

So please live and love,
The conditions are too pricey to say,
The Truth be told once again,
You never came here to always stay!
So why fit in anyway?
