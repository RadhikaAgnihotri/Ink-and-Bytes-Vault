The one that lingers, near or far,
The steadfast presence, my evening star,
The whisperer behind my back,
Of good things and straight up facts...

The one who whispers love each day,
The one who'd speak to my lifeless clay,
The one who parted for her academic quest,   ## The one who left me for her studies,
Or the one who chose me over the rest.       ## Or the one who left her studies for me?

Lessons learnt ; times well spent
I am so grateful for that friend!

The one who thought was using me,
The one who felt used by me,
The one whom I left through my stupidity,
The one whom I didn't leave by my stupidity.

Sometimes quietness ; Sometimes a non-stop vent
I am so grateful for that friend!
I wish you knew, to me what it truly meant.
I hope you know, now, what it truly meant.

The one who wanted me always to tag along,
The one who made plans to me unknown,
The one whose weather maintained the bond,      ##weather means her mind/heart, when it felt like
The one who'd be there through a storm's mourn.

Friendships of my dreams, platonic bonds of present,
I am so thankful for that friend.

The one with intentions hidden and dark,
The one who wanted me to shine and spark,
The one who never remembers my birth date,
The one who notices the minuscule details.

The one who always cried and complained,
The one who smiled through every pain,
Oh yes, and that narcissistic personification,
And also the timid one, unaware of her sparkling diadems.

With some cultivated real friendship,
With some just a namesake trend,
I am so grateful for both that friend and that so-called friend.

The one who gets mad at little things,
The one who takes to heart only what is meant.
The one with pretty eyes, or hair, or voice,
The one so perfect, left us no choice.      ##no choice as in, we hd to be great friends, it was useless to compare

Starting up the friendship or that friend's acquaintance,
I am always grateful for that friend, and that friend's friend.
