Heart break, the feeling of betrayal,
the feeling of lost faith,
when expections don't manifest,
and good things give distaste.

A loved one said something rude,
A friend's broken promise,
A beloved left you on a lonely route,
A planet hit by a colossal comet.   

Heart break is not just metaphorical,
it could manifest as something as real as pain,
as real as the dark clouds before rain, 
the pulsating ache at the core of your chest,
filling my days with so much unrest

The pain altered the biology of the heart,
even hurts to gather yourself up, like
collecting shattered broken glass

My older self is curled up in the corner,
I've distanced myself from it like it is some stranger,
The weird thing is that even the mirror feels like that,
Where is my true self, did I also lose it? 

if you let it it will 
change the biology of the heart,
break those cells beyond repair,
leave a permanent scar
