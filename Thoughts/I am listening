I hate myself,
I'd rather be that handsome guy, or that pretty gal
I want to look a certain way,
I can't replace my face
 
I am listening,
and I want to give you want you want,
So you can either accept me as it is or
I will ensure what you say isn't at all wrong

And if you crib and cry over my creation
I will make sure you have enough reasons

So as soon as I heard it all,
I suddenly fell in love with the reflection on the mirror on the wall,

And to my surprise, somebody complimented my eyes,
I dressed up my body, all praises showered from the skies

I let my skin be skin, with all the scars and pores,
Because it's doing the best already for what it was made for

I don't have to have his or her pretty face,
Cause mine has its own unique grace

My imperfections aren't imperfections at all
They just make me Me, the same creator made us all

I want to chase the beauty of the heart now, 
I want to look beautiful for HIM somehow,

And he will only look at my deeds,
How well I treated his creations, did I appreciate what I see and where I be?
